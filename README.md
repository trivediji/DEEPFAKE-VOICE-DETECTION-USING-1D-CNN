# DEEPFAKE-VOICE-DETECTION-USING-1D-CNN
Real-time deepfake voice detection using 1D-CNN, Librosa, and TensorFlow. Upload audio via a simple Tkinter GUI and get instant real/fake predictions. Built with Python, trained on Kaggle dataset.
# DeepFake Voice Detection

This is a real-time deepfake voice detection project built using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It takes an audio input, extracts features using Librosa, and predicts whether the voice is real or fake. A simple Tkinter-based GUI allows users to upload `.wav` files and get instant results without using the command line.

Key Features:

* Detects real vs fake voices from audio clips
* Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Librosa
* MFCC feature extraction for audio processing
* User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
* Trained on a balanced dataset from Kaggle

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tkinter

How to Use:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run `gui.py`
4. Upload an audio file and get the prediction instantly

Future Improvements:

* Improve model generalization and accuracy
* Add support for spectrograms and 2D CNN
* Deploy with Flask or Streamlit for web access

Contributions and feedback are always welcome. Feel free to fork the repo, experiment, and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate!
